# GPS
A GPS unit with custom clock and speed screens

Based on A GPS receiver board with included antenna using the NEO6MV2 module, outputting NMEA data at 9600 baud each second. All is coordinated by a MEGA 2560 compatible microcontroller board. Information is displayed on a 128x64 LCD screen. Control is effected by just two push buttons interfaced to the microcontroller with a hardware debouncing circuit that utilizes the 74HC14 Schmitt trigger IC.
